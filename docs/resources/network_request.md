## Schema

### Required

- `base_cidr` (String) - The base range, which the particular cidr range will be cut out from. In combination with the provider configuration, this will produce a unique file in your selected GCP bucket.
- `netmask_id` (String) - A unique identifier for the cidr range to be reserved; when using a netmask_id which is already in use by another resource, this will result in an error.
- `prefix_length` (Number) - The prefix of the new cidr range to be reserved. Can be any integer between 0 and 32, but must be larger or equal to the base cidr range in use!

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `netmask` (String) The reserved cidr range.
